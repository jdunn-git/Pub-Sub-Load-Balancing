# Pub-Sub with Zookeeper Load Balancing

This project demonstrates the use of pub-sub models using zookeeper to load balance connections from multiple publishers to multiple subscribers. It can be run with or without a broker coordinating the messages between the pubs and subs, and it also has timing experiments showing the impact of the different permutations this project can be run with.

This project was created in three parts as a part of a masters course on Distributed Systems. The assignment3 folder is where everything came together to support the pubs, subs, broker, and zookeeper api services.
